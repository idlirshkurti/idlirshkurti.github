## Scribbles and nonsense

Hi there! I'm Idlir, a data scientist with a passion for maths, data and football. This blog is my personal space where I make some (sometimes random) notes about data science, mathematics, Python, and some personal projects I might be working on.

Here, you'll find:

* **Mathematical explorations** that delve into the foundations of data science.
* **Python tutorials and code snippets** to help me learn and implement data science solutions.
* **Personal projects** that showcase my creative applications of data science.
* **Random musings** on anything that sparks my interest, from the latest AI advancements to Fantasy Football.
