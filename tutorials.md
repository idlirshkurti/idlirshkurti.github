## The Dev Hub: Programming Playground 

This is where I keep my notes, tutorials, and experiments as I continue to learn and grow as a programmer.  

**Here's what you'll find:**

* **Python Deep Dive:** Notes on Python fundamentals, data structures, functions, and object-oriented programming.
* **Unit Testing:** How to write effective unit tests to ensure code quality and reliability.
* **API Chronicles:** Building and interacting with APIs using Python.
* **Actor-Based Models:** Exploring the principles of actor-based concurrency for building scalable event-driven applications.
* **Automating My Workflow:**  Using tools like Makefiles, Justfiles, and Nox to streamline development workflows.

This is a living document, constantly evolving as I learn and discover new things.
